This folder contains three main files. An entity relationship diagram detailing the different inter-relationships between the different entities (one-many and/or one-one), with the primary keys properly marked. This relationship structure would be leveraged subsequently while answering the three questions posed in this exercise

The remaining two files are for loading and manipulating the data namely the datalake shell script and the ddl script. They are fairly self-explanatory in their content. 

References: While I started this exercise last month, I sought active help from MIDS alumni, online repositories etc since I have hardly any background in this. Though that is still true for the remaining two sections, for the datalake and ddl script, I could successfully create myself after going through Kevin Crook videos on Exercise 1 (The first two videos for Exercise 1 became immensely handly for this section)
